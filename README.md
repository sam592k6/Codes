This To-Do List App is a simple yet effective tool for managing daily activities built by using Python

It has the following features :

Users can put their daily day to day tasks
They can set specific dates and times as deadlines to complete their tasks
They are allowed to set priority to the task
On completing their To-do list regularly they will receive a streak which increases with an increase in completion


Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the todo_app.py file using Python 3.x.
Follow the prompts to start managing your tasks!
Feel free to explore the code, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions for enhancements :))
